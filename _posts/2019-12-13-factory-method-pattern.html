<h1>Factory Method Design Pattern</h1>
<p>
  In today's episode of <strong>Software Design Patterns</strong> you will learn
  everything about the <strong>Factory Method Design Pattern</strong>. The
  Factory Method is a creational pattern. That means that the pattern has
  something to do with object creation. There are different types of design
  patterns. The other types are <strong>structural</strong> and
  <strong>behavioral</strong>. Those types will have a dedicated blog post in
  the future.
</p>
<p>
  For reference - the last article covered the
  <a href="https://www.patrickschadler.com/singleton-design-pattern/"
    >Singleton Design Pattern</a
  >
  - which is also a creational pattern. All the examples, source code and unit
  tests are in this
  <a href="https://github.com/DonkeyKongJr/FactoryMethodPattern"
    >GitHub repository</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>What’s the purpose of the Factory Method Design Pattern?</h2>
<p>
  The Factory Method is a very common pattern, but strongly misused. I have seen
  many examples where methods were named factory, but did something completely
  different. The quote below - <em>taken from the Gang of Four</em> - is very
  precise about the Factory Method.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Factory Method Design Pattern defines an interface for creating an
    object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method
    lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses. [1]
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Don't fall into the trap and use it for everything. If you are not sure about
  when to use, you probably don't need it anyway.
</p>
<h2>How does the Factory Method looks like?</h2>
<p>
  In the picture below you find the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram.

  As mentioned at the beginning you find all the code examples in a working
  project on
  <a href="https://github.com/DonkeyKongJr/FactoryMethodPattern">GitHub</a>.

{% highlight csharp %}
public interface ICar
{
	string GetName();
	void Accelerate();
	void Break();
}

public class ElectricCar : ICar
{
	public int Speed { get; private set; }

	public string GetName()
	{
		return "Electric";
	}

	public void Accelerate()
	{
		Speed = Speed + 2;
	}

	public void Break()
	{
		if (Speed > 0)
		{
			Speed--;
		}
	}
}

public class PetrolCar : ICar
{
	public int Speed { get; private set; }

	public string GetName()
	{
		return "Petrol";
	}

	public void Accelerate()
	{
		Speed++;
	}

	public void Break()
	{
		if (Speed > 0)
		{
			Speed--;
		}
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  In this example we have an interface <strong>ICar.cs</strong>, which provides
  basic car operations like accelerate and break. In addition to that we have an
  <strong>GetName()</strong> method, were the concrete implementation should
  return the actual name of the car.
</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public class CarFactory
{
	public ICar CreateCar(string type)
	{
		if (string.Equals(type, "Petrol", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
		{
			return new PetrolCar();
		}

		if (string.Equals(type, "Electric", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
		{
			return new ElectricCar();
		}

		throw new NotSupportedException($"Car Type '{type}' is not supported");
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Our Factory, called <strong>CarFactory.cs</strong>, is responsible for
  creating instances of concrete cars. We provide a dedicated
  <strong>CreateCar(string type)</strong> method, where the desired type can be
  passed as an argument. The method maps the type to a concrete implementation.
  This can be done via multiple <strong>if</strong> clauses or a
  <strong>switch statement</strong>. Anyway, if there is no matching type we
  throw an <strong>NotSupportedException</strong> to make it clear that the
  factory does not support the desired type.
</p>
<p>
  To see the proper use of the <strong>CarFactory</strong> look into the test
  project.
</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public class CarFactoryTest
{
	[Theory]
	[InlineData("Electric")]
	[InlineData("electric")]
	[InlineData("eLeCtriC")]
	public void ShouldCreateElectricCarInstance(string type)
	{
		var carFactory = new CarFactory();
		var car = carFactory.CreateCar(type);

		car.Should().BeOfType<ElectricCar>();
		car.GetName().Should().Be("Electric");
	}

	[Theory]
	[InlineData("Petrol")]
	[InlineData("petrol")]
	[InlineData("pEtRoL")]
	public void ShouldCreatePetrolCarInstance(string type)
	{
		var carFactory = new CarFactory();
		var car = carFactory.CreateCar(type);

		car.Should().BeOfType<PetrolCar>();
		car.GetName().Should().Be("Petrol");
	}

	[Theory]
	[InlineData("hans")]
	[InlineData("car")]
	[InlineData("electricpetrol")]
	public void ShouldThrowNotSupportedExceptionWhenTypeIsInvalid(string type)
	{
		var carFactory = new CarFactory();
		Action getCar = () => carFactory.CreateCar(type);

		getCar.Should().ThrowExactly<NotSupportedException>();
	}
}
