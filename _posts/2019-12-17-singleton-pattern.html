<h1>Singleton Design Pattern</h1>
<p>
  With this post a brand-new series about Software Design Patterns starts. You
  will learn everything about the most used Design Patterns. The first is
  probably the most known. It is the Singleton Design Pattern. It is one of the
  twenty-three well-known - and industry standard -

<h2>What's the purpose of the Singleton Design Pattern?</h2>
<p>
  In software development we often instantiate a class many times. This could be
  problematic. As a result you have to deal with many instances of the very same
  class. This introduces complexity and increases memory usage of the
  application.
</p>
<p>
  The Singleton Design Pattern solves this specific issue. It ensures that only
  one instance of this class exists. Beyond that it standardizes and eases the
  access to that instance. To access the instance a Singleton provides per
  design a static `GetInstance()` method. To prevent any instantiating via the
  new keyword you have to hide the constructor.
</p>
<h2>How does the Singleton Design Pattern looks like?</h2>
<p>
  In the picture below you find the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram.

  The very basic implementation doesn't care about thread-safety. It's called
  <a

    >BasicSingleton</a
  >
  within the GitHub Repository.
</p>
{% highlight csharp %}
public class BasicSingleton
{
    public string Name => "Singleton";
    private static BasicSingleton instance;
    
    private BasicSingleton(){ }

    public static BasicSingleton GetInstance()
    {
        if(instance == default(BasicSingleton)){
                instance = new BasicSingleton();
        }

        return instance;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
<h2>How about Thread-Safety?</h2>
<p>
  This implementation could lead to problems when many threads calls the
  <em>GetInstance() </em>simultaneously. For example the second thread enters
  the if condition while the first isn't finished yet. Thus, a second instance
  will be created. This behavior violates the Singleton Design Pattern
  definition. The
  <a
    href="https://github.com/DonkeyKongJr/SingletonDesignPattern/blob/master/src/ThreadSafeSingleton.cs"
    >ThreadSafeSingleton</a
  >
  prevents those race conditions with locking the access to a thread at a time.
  This guarantees that only one instance will ever be created. Keep in mind that
  every time we access the Singleton we perform a lock which uses a bit more
  resources.

{% highlight csharp %}
public class ThreadSafeSingleton
{
    public string Name => "Singleton";
    private static ThreadSafeSingleton instance;
    private static readonly object singletonlock = new object();  
    
    private ThreadSafeSingleton(){ }

    public static ThreadSafeSingleton GetInstance()
    {
        lock (singletonlock)  
        {  
            if(instance == default(ThreadSafeSingleton))
            {
                instance = new ThreadSafeSingleton();
            }

            return instance;
        }          
    }
}

<p>Thatâ€™s it. Happy coding as always :).</p>
