<h1>Builder Design Pattern</h1>
<p>
  In today’s episode of <strong>Software Design Patterns</strong> you will learn
  everything about the <strong>Builder Design Pattern</strong>. The Builder
  Pattern is also pretty common and widely used. Different from the already
  covered <strong>behavioral</strong> pattern
  <a href="https://www.patrickschadler.com/observer-design-pattern/">Observer</a
  >, the Builder Pattern is a creational design patterns like
  <a href="https://www.patrickschadler.com/singleton-design-pattern/"
    >Singleton</a
  >
  and
  <a href="https://www.patrickschadler.com/factory-method-design-pattern/"
    >Factory Method</a
  >
  pattern.
</p>
<p>
  All the examples, source code and unit tests are in this
  <a href="https://github.com/DonkeyKongJr/BuilderPattern">GitHub repository</a
  >.
</p>
<h2>What’s the purpose of the Builder Design Pattern?</h2>
<p>
  The <strong>Gang-of-Four</strong> [1] reference book ("<em
    >Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em
  >") describes the intent of the Builder Pattern as the following.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so
    that the same construction process can create different representations.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Basically you have a <strong>builder</strong> and a <strong>director</strong>.
  In my example on
  <a href="https://github.com/DonkeyKongJr/BuilderPattern">GitHub</a> I use
  different types of houses. There is a builder for flat and hipped houses.
  Those builders are created and passed to the director. The director itself
  constructs the different houses. To retrieve the built house the actual
  builder has a method for this (<em>GetHouse()</em>). Via this you can use the
  concrete house implementation.
</p>
<h2>How does the Builder look like?</h2>
<p>
  In the picture below you find the Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram.

<p>
  In the linked
  <a href="https://github.com/DonkeyKongJr/BuilderPattern">GitHub repository</a>
  you will find interfaces for the <strong>IHouseBuilder</strong> and the
  <strong>IDirector</strong>. Many resources advise you to use abstract base
  classes for the director and the builder - which is totally fine. I simply
  like interfaces more, so I went this route. The IHousebuilder interface
  contains the definition for building the house and retrieving the build
  instance. The <strong>IDirector</strong> simply has a construct method. In
  this method all steps should be done to build a specific thing - in our case a
  given type of house. The <strong>House</strong> class stores the model of a
  house. To make it simple I minimized the house to four property with getter
  only. To set value, you have to use the constructor when creating a house.

	public House(string paintingColor, string roofType, int numbersOfFloors, bool hasCellar)
	{
		PaintingColor = paintingColor;
		RoofType = roofType;
		NumbersOfFloors = numbersOfFloors;
		HasCellar = hasCellar;
	}
}</pre

<p>
  The concrete house builders sets the correspondending values when creating a
  new instance.
</p>
<pre class="font-size:14 lang:c# decode:true  " title="FlatRoofHouseBuilder.cs">
public class FlatRoofHouseBuilder : IHouseBuilder
{
	private House _house = default(House);

	public void BuildHouse()
	{
		_house = new House("white", "flat", 1, false);
	}

	public House GetHouse()
	{
		return _house;
	}
}</pre

<pre
  class="font-size:14 lang:c# decode:true  "
  title="HippedRoofHouseBuilder.cs"
>
public class HippedRoofHouseBuilder : IHouseBuilder
{
	private House _house = default(House);

	public void BuildHouse()
	{
		_house = new House("gray", "hipped", 2, true);
	}

	public House GetHouse()
	{
		return _house;
	}
}</pre
>
<p>
  The construct method on the director initiates the build process for the given
  house builder.
</p>
<pre class="font-size:14 lang:c# decode:true  " title="HouseBuildDirector.cs">
public class HouseBuildDirector : IDirector
{
	private readonly IHouseBuilder _houseBuilder;

	public HouseBuildDirector(IHouseBuilder houseBuilder)
	{
		_houseBuilder = houseBuilder;
	}

	public void Construct()
	{
		_houseBuilder.BuildHouse();
	}
}</pre
>
<p>
  In the unit tests you see the whole process of how to use the builder pattern.
  In this case it seems pretty odd to use such a pattern, but imagine that the
  complete build/construct process takes many complex steps.
</p>
<pre class="font-size:14 lang:c# decode:true  " title="BuilderPatternTest.cs">
public class BuilderPatternTest
{
	[Fact]
	public void ShouldBuildFlatHouse()
	{
		var flatHouseBuilder = new FlatRoofHouseBuilder();
		var houseBuildDirector = new HouseBuildDirector(flatHouseBuilder);

		houseBuildDirector.Construct();

		var house = flatHouseBuilder.GetHouse();

		house.HasCellar.Should().BeFalse();
		house.PaintingColor.Should().Be("white");
		house.RoofType.Should().Be("flat");
		house.NumbersOfFloors.Should().Be(1);
	}

	[Fact]
	public void ShouldBuildHippedHouse()
	{
		var hippedRoofHouseBuilder = new HippedRoofHouseBuilder();
		var houseBuildDirector = new HouseBuildDirector(hippedRoofHouseBuilder);

		houseBuildDirector.Construct();

		var house = hippedRoofHouseBuilder.GetHouse();

		house.HasCellar.Should().BeTrue();
		house.PaintingColor.Should().Be("gray");
		house.RoofType.Should().Be("hipped");
		house.NumbersOfFloors.Should().Be(2);
	}

  Appendix: There are many ways of describing the builder pattern. Often it's
  mistaken by a fluent library where you chain different methods and eventually
  build an object from it. Let me know in the comments below how you find the
  builder or how you learned it.
</p>
<p>
  In the test project you'll find test cases for subscribing, notifying and
  unsubscribing from observers.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below.</p>
<p>That’s it. Happy coding as always :).</p>
