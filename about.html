<p>
  Hello you! Welcome to Schadler Solutions - your IT Professional - it's a
  pleasure for me to welcome you here.
</p>
<p>
  I would describe myself as a normal guy from Austria in his early 30s who
  loves everything which is related to technology, football, photography and
  travelling. Through my educational and professional career I have gained huge
  knowledge in programming with object-oriented languages like C# and Java and
  script languages like JavaScript and everything which is connected to the Word
  Wide Web - HTML, CSS, JSON, REST, SOAP, XML to count some :-).
</p>
<p>
  Besides that I had finished the Bachelor Degree in <em>Software Design</em> at
  the <a href="https://fh-joanneum.at/">FH-Joanneum</a> in 2014 and directly
  afterwards I finished the Master's Degree <em>IT Law &amp; Management</em> in
  2016 there. Both were extra-occupational.
</p>
<p>
  In the <a href="/posts/">Blog</a> section I try to push new quality content
  about programming with C#, Web Services, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and Web
  Technologies. Let me know what you think about it and if you have any specific
  questions or feature topic request - just let me know.
</p>
<p>
  I would love to connect with you guys! You'll find me at various (probably
  all) social media networks, here on my homepage and of course via this little
  old thing called <a href="mailto:office@patrickschadler.com">email</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Have fun - Patrick Schadler
